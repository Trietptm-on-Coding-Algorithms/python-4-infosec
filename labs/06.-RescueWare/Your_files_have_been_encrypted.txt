Hello @empresa,

Your data has been encrypted and can't be recovered if you don't pay.
You have three days to trasfer ten tons of corn to Manoteras' Avenue,
in Madrid, or your data will remain encrypted forever.

Don't try to decrypt your files, they have been encrypted using two
diferent and strong RC4 key... muahahaha

Send the corn and you will get your files back. Don't call S2grupo.
